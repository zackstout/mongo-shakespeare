 ## Getting Started
 In order to run this app on your machine, you'll need to generate the database. This takes two steps:
 - First download or clone this repo and run `npm install`.
 - Then, uncomment the `generateDB()` function call in `router.js` and run `npm start`. This should take about 15 minutes. After completion, you can comment out this line.
